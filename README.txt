I got my JavaScript code for displaying the timer on Chatgpt, initially i had 'REQUIRED' attribute in all my radio buttons, and my next and previous
buttons were not working properly so I did further research of which is where i found out in Deepseek that the 'required'
attribute I had on my radio buttons was causing the next and previous buttons to not work because each radio button was expecting to be selected then
Deepseek provided me with the correct code for my functions and review form.
